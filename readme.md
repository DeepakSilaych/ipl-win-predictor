Welcome to the "IPL Win Predictor" project! This machine learning model, built using logistic regression, predicts the probability of a team winning an IPL match based on the current match situation. Get ready to make data-driven predictions!

## About This Project

The "IPL Win Predictor" leverages logistic regression to provide insights into the probability of a team winning an IPL match. This model analyzes various match features, team performance, and player statistics to offer real-time predictions.

### Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Get live predictions for IPL match outcomes based on the current match situation.

- **Interactive Interface**: The predictor is deployed on Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for exploring match scenarios.

- **Customizable Inputs**: Adjust the match parameters and teams to simulate different match scenarios.

- **Deployment**: Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and sharing.

## Usage

To make predictions, provide the following parameters when prompted:

- **Batting Team**: The team currently at bat.
- **Bowling Team**: The team currently bowling.
- **City**: The location of the match.
- **Current runs**: The current score of batting team.
- **Overs Completed**: The number of overs completed.
- **Wickets**: The number of wickets lost.
- **Target Runs**: The total runs scored by a bowling team.

The predictor will calculate the probability of the batting team winning based on these parameters and the current match situation.
